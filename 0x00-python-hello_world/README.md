# 0x00-python-hello_world

This project is an introductory project to high-level programming and python by ALX_AFRICA

### task 0:
Write a Shell script that runs a Python script whose name is saved in the environment variable $PYFILE

### task 1:
Write a Shell script that runs Python code that is saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

### task 2:
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line

### task 3:
print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.
You are not allowed to cast the variable number into a string
Your code must be 3 lines long
You have to use f-strings

### task 4:
print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

### task 5:
print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

### task 6:
Complete the source code to print Welcome to Holberton School!
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.
You have to use the variables str1 and str2 in your new line of code
Your program should be exactly 5 lines long

### task 7:
make and print these variables,
word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

### task 8:
print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line.
Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
You are not allowed to create new variables
You are not allowed to use string literals

### task 9:
Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

### task 10:
Technical interview preparation:
You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle

### task 11:
Write a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line.
Use the function write from the sys module
You are not allowed to use print
Your script should print to stderr
Your script should exit with the status code 1

### task 12:
Write a script that compiles a Python script file.
The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE
The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc)
